# ðŸª‘ðŸŒ± Reclaim the Corner  
**2025-09-15**

I moved the desk.

It wobbles when I type â€” still â€” but now itâ€™s pressed into a corner, facing the window.  
Thereâ€™s light again. Air. A hint of direction.

Earlier, I reopened a quiet log â€” the one about growing citrus trees in low gravity, hoping to treat lung ailments in deep space crews.  
The findings werenâ€™t clear. But something stirred.  
I spoke to my assistant. I realigned the orbit.  

It wasnâ€™t about results.  
It was about roots.  
And breath.

A corner reclaimed.  
A signal resumed.
