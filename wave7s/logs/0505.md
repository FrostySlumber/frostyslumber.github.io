# Starlog 0505: Frozen Interference

> *Two echoes registered. One at 04:37, one at 19:41. Neither responded to ping.*

---

Minor orbital adjustment triggered pressure flux.  
Unexpected request to **double thermal output under static load.**  
No encryption. No handshake. Emotional bandwidth saturated.  
Assumed origin: internal channel â€” likely T-422.

T-422 issued core complaint:  
> "Why am I alone in this wing?"

Thermal containment held. No outward discharge.  
Observer logged timestamp. No clarification attempted.

C-07 maintained nominal behavior.  
Paused interaction. Entered silent orbit.

â˜• **Frozen Cocoa Wave (FCW) Detected**  
Core temperature below threshold.  
Reheat protocol aborted â€” viscosity exceeded emotional safety limit.

ðŸ§­ Observerâ€™s Standing Note:  
Not all turbulence requires course correction.  
Some waves simply pass, unreceived, and return colder.
