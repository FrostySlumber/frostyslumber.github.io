# ðŸŒŠ Wave 7S  
**Your last signal before silence.**  

> _This is not a journal. Itâ€™s a slow-orbit record of emotional weather near the Taurus sector._

---

Each log is a broadcast sent without expectation of reply.  
Some are calm. Some are static. Some are storms with no names.

Inside this sector:  
- A command unit prone to silent overloads.  
- A small auxiliary pilot (C-07) still learning patterns.  
- An observer (you) recording what you can before you forget what normal felt like.
