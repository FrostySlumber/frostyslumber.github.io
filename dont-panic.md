# Don't Panic: A Static Hitchhiker's Guide

> From index.html to README.md ‚Äî a quiet note for those who remember the sound of dial-up.

Once upon a time, we uploaded via FTP,  
wrote layout with tables,  
and named every image like it mattered.

Now we push to main,  
write in Markdown,  
and let GitHub render our memories.

### üõ∞Ô∏è For the Ancient Ones Who Remembered the Web

| Then (1996‚Äì2000)         | Now (GitHub Pages)           | Notes |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| `index.html`             | `README.md`                  | Becomes the homepage |
| `about.html`             | `about.md`                   | Each page = one .md file |
| `/images/logo.jpg`       | `/images/logo.jpg`           | Still works the same |
| `style.css`              | Theme or custom CSS          | Optional now |
| FTP upload               | Git commit & push            | Git is the new FTP |
| Folder navigation        | Repository structure         | Still hierarchical |
| Dreamweaver, FrontPage   | GitHub web editor            | Less drag, more think |
| No versioning            | Git history                  | Every edit remembered |
| Hit counters             | Nobody cares                 | Welcome to the void |

### üß† Why Write This

Because someone out there might still remember  
when the web felt handmade.

This is for you.  
Not to teach, but to whisper:  
You're not alone.

And yes ‚Äî `42` still means something.
