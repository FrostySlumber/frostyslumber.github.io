Protocolized City
Quiet Notes on Web3’s Institutional Landscape

This page is an ongoing notebook exploring Web3 as a system of institutions built not from law or territory, but from executable rules known as protocols.

The term Protocolized City refers to the idea that blockchain ecosystems behave like urban formations:
with actors, spaces, flows, and governance processes —
but all defined and enforced by code.

This is not a public project.
It is a place to think quietly, to observe, and to record what becomes visible when we treat Web3 not as hype or speculation, but as a set of social facts.

More sections will appear over time:

Institutions

Space

Flows

Notes & Fragments

For now, this page simply marks the beginning of a new corner in the archive.
