# Protocolized City  
### Quiet Notes on Web3’s Institutional Landscape

This notebook explores Web3 as a system of institutions built not from law or territory,  
but from executable rules known as **protocols**.

The term **Protocolized City** refers to the idea that blockchain ecosystems behave like urban formations —  
with **actors**, **spaces**, **flows**, and **governance processes** —  
all defined and enforced by **code**.

This is not a public project.  
It is a place to think quietly, to observe, and to record what becomes visible when we treat Web3  
not as hype or speculation, but as a set of **social facts**.
