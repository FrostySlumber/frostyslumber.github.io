# Wake Up

> I don’t bookmark pages. I just remember how I got there.

There’s a kind of knowledge that hides behind ten clicks,  
two mistyped keywords, and one lucky guess.  

Some people call it “not reproducible.”  
I call it the only kind of search worth doing.

I once found an anime torrent site  
through a forum post in 2013,  
linked by someone whose account no longer exists.

I didn’t save it.  
But I remembered the shape of the route.

A few years later, I re-found it.  
Not the same URL. Not the same server.  
But the same path.

That’s why I wake up sometimes  
just to trace where something *might* be.  
Even if it’s not there anymore.
